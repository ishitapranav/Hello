## Your own Environment
<p> Now, this is not really a place you were to travel to, but it is also important to acknowledge your own surroundings and appreciating that first. Here are some pictures that I had took myself at my school. Although I was not able to find out what type of flower it was, the first one kind of reminds me of the sun. The next one is the favorite of many people, including me, the Rose.

  <p> Located in Carlsbad, California, this magnificent field is filled with flowers of all colors. When you see it from a distance as a whole, it looks like a rainbow itself has formed on land. The different colors of the various types of flowers really enhances its elegance.
